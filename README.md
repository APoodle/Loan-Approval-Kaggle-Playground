# <div align='center'>🏛️ Loan Approval Kaggle Playground 🏛️ </div>

### Overview
The objective of this project is to get used to using machine learning concepts again. Currently I am trying to use tensorflow to be able to categorize binary categories. In a more abstract sense, I am trying to predict whether or not to approve a loan depending on the information given.

### Prerequisites
To fully understand the process and the concepts used for this project, I would recommend having a good understanding of:
- Python and Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-Learn
- The Python Libraries Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib
- TensorFlow
